A simple Tinode chatbot framework.

The name of the library `Karuha` comes from the character Karuha Ramukone (カルハ・ラムコネ) in the game 星空鉄道とシロの旅.

## Installation

From pip:

    pip install KaruhaBot

From source code:

    git clone https://github.com/Ovizro/Karuha.git
    cd Karuha
    make install

## Quick Start

> Before starting, you need to make sure you have the Tinode service running locally with its gRPC port set to the default value of 16060. If your service is not local or the default port has been changed, you need to add additional server configuration items in the following code.

Create a new file `config.json` and write the following content:

```json
{
    "server": {
        "host": "localhost:16060",
        "listen": "0.0.0.0:40051"
    },
    "bots": [
        {
            "name": "chatbot",
            "schema": "basic",
            "secret": "{chatbot_login_name}:{chatebot_login_passwd}"
        }
    ]
}
```

> Replace `{chatbot_login_name}` and `{chatebot_login_passwd}` with the chatbot’s login account name and password in the Tinode server.

Start the chatbot using the following command:

    python -m Karuha ./config.json

You can now see the messages others have sent to the chatbot from the command line.Yeah, that's it, no more. 

## Go Further?

Well, you can actually go a step further and send messages to users.

Currently, if you want to reply to a message, you currently need to add a handler for the event yourself. This is not a simple process. Fortunately, we are about to introduce a command module to improve this.

Because this is a relatively low-level API, I will only give an example to show how karuha is currently used in python:

```python
import karuha
from karuha import Bot, MessageEvent, PublishEvent


bot = Bot(
    "chatbot",
    "basic",
    "chatbot:123456"
)


@karuha.on(MessageEvent)
async def reply(event: MessageEvent) -> None:
    bot = event.bot


if __name__ == "__main__":
    karuha.load_config()
    karuha.add_bot(bot)
    karuha.run()
```
