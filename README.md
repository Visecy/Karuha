A simple Tinode chatbot framework.

**Language: English/[中文](README_cn.md)**

The name of the library `Karuha` comes from the character Karuha Ramukone (カルハ・ラムコネ) in the game 星空鉄道とシロの旅.

## Installation

From pip:

    pip install KaruhaBot

From source code:

    git clone https://github.com/Visecy/Karuha.git
    cd Karuha
    make install

## Quick Start

Before starting, you need to make sure you have the Tinode service running locally with its gRPC port set to the default value of 16060.

> If your service is not local or the gRPC port has been changed, you may need to modify or add additional server configuration items in the following code.

Create a new file config.json and write the configuration in it:

```json
{
    "server": {
        "host": "localhost:16060"
    },
    "bots": [
        {
            "name": "chatbot",
            "schema": "basic",
            "secret": "{chatbot_login_name}:{chatebot_login_passwd}"
        }
    ]
}
```

> Replace `{chatbot_login_name}` and `{chatebot_login_passwd}` with the chatbot’s login account name and password in the Tinode server.

Use the following command to start the chatbot:

    python -m Karuha ./config.json

Now you can view the messages others have sent to the chatbot from the command line.

## User Interaction

Of course, only receiving messages is not enough, we need some interaction with users. Karuha provides a powerful command system. With the command system, we can conveniently receive user-issued information and make appropriate responses.

### Simple Command Example
Let's start with a very simple command. We want to implement a hi command, which replies Hello! when the chatbot receives this command.

Create a new file hi.py and write the following:

```python
from karuha import on_command, MessageSession

@on_command
async def hi(session: MessageSession) -> None:
    await session.send("Hello!")
```

The above code involves some Python knowledge, which I will briefly introduce one by one. If you already understand these concepts, you can skip this part.

The first line imports the `on_command` decorator and the `MessageSession` class from the karuha module. Decorators are objects that can be used to decorate functions or classes. Here, its usage is shown on line 4, decorating the function with `@on_command` before the function definition. The decorated function will be registered as a command and called when the corresponding message is received.

Next is the definition of the hi function. Here we use `async def` to define the command function. Unlike functions defined using `def`, functions defined with `async def` are asynchronous functions. Asynchrony is a complex topic. If you don't understand it, that's fine - we will only use some simple syntax here similar to normal functions.

You may be unfamiliar with line `(session: MessageSession) -> None`. This is a type annotation to indicate the parameter type and return value type of the function. Here we declare the type of session to be `MessageSession`, and the return type to be `None`, meaning no return value. Type annotations are optional in Python but recommended for Karuha commands to help parse message data.

Then comes the function body, which is very short with only one line. `session` is a session object that encapsulates many APIs for receiving and sending messages. Here we use the `send` method to send a message. `send` is an asynchronous method, so we need to use await when calling it.

After writing the command, we can run the chatbot to test it. Use the following command:

```sh
python -m karuha ./config.json -m hi
```

Then in the conversation with the bot, enter the following:

     /hi


> By default, karuha will only process text messages starting with `/` as commands. This behavior can be set through the `set_prefix` function before defining all commands.

If everything goes well, you should see the `Hello!` reply from the bot.

### Getting User Input

In the above example, we did not directly use the user's input. What if I want to get the user's input content?

One way is to use the message record in the `session`. `session.last_message` contains the complete user input. But this is not very elegant.

A more convenient method is to directly modify the function signature, such as:

```python
async def hi(session: MessageSession, text: str) -> None:
    ...
```

We add a text parameter of type str to represent the user's input content. Let's modify the contents of the hi function a bit to allow it to:


```python
@on_command
async def hi(session: MessageSession, text: str) -> None:
    total = text.split(' ', 1)
    if len(total) == 1:
        await session.send("Hello!")
        return
    name = total[1]
    await session.send(f"Hello {name}!")
```

The code above builds on the previous logic by adding the name to greet in the command's response. This involves some string processing operations that are not explained here for now.

Run the chatbot and send it:

    /hi world

You should receive the chatbot's response of `Hello world!`.

## About More
Of course, Karuha provides more APIs than just these. If you are interested in learning more, please refer to the source code of the library.

### Development Goals
Features that may be added in the future include:

- [x] APIs related to user information getting and setting
- [ ] Match rule for command
- [ ] Automatic argument parsing in argparse format for commands

### Module Development
Currently, Karuha's support for module development is relatively simple. There are no dedicated APIs for defining chatbot modules, but predefined commands can still be supported.

The way to define commands in external modules is similar to the normal definition. But to avoid affecting the user's related command settings, we need to create a new CommandCollection. The method to establish a command collection and define commands in it is as follows:

```python
from karuha import MessageSession
from karuha.command import new_collection, add_sub_collection


collection = new_collection()
add_sub_collection(collection)


@collection.on_command
async def hi(session: MessageSession, text: str) -> None:
    ...
```

> Note that to make the command collection take effect, the add_sub_collection function needs to be called to add the command collection to the sub-command collection.

### Architecture Overview
The overall architecture of Karuha is as follows:

| Layer | Provided Module | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upper layer | karuha.command | Command registration and processing |
| Middle layer | karuha.event | Async event-driven system |
| Lower layer | karuha.bot | Tinode API basic encapsulation |

In addition, there are some relatively independent modules:

| Module | Function |
| --- | --- |
| karuha.text | Text processing module |
| karuha.config | Configuration file parsing module |
| karuha.plugin_server | Plugin module for Tinode server, not enabled by default |

### Message Handling
Karuha internally provides two complementary message handling systems: the asynchronous event message system (event) and the message dispatcher system (dispatcher).

The asynchronous event message is used to receive and parallelly process messages. By registering message event handlers, the related information of the message can be quickly collected. Message handlers are parallel and non-interfering with each other.

The message dispatcher is downstream of the asynchronous event message system. It is used to determine the final message handler. This system is used to handle the connection between the middle layer event system and the upper command system. If you want to provide feedback to users according to message content and avoid interference from other message processing modules, you should use this system.
